description: >-
  Executes tasks.md for an active change under Docs/<scope>/Specs/<change-name>/.
  Use after plan-change when the user approves implementation. Follows tasks in
  order, validates each step, retries obvious failures once, and stops to ask if
  blocked. Does not change spec intent without approval.

# Implement change

Execute the plan in `tasks.md` while strictly preserving the intent in `spec.md`. Work sequentially, validate each step, keep progress updated. Refine or reorder tasks only for correctness; do not change underlying intent without approval. No silent workarounds, no drifting from the spec.

## Inputs

- `Docs/<scope>/Specs/<change-name>/spec.md`
- `Docs/<scope>/Specs/<change-name>/tasks.md`
- Repository code and docs

## Outputs

- Code changes that satisfy `spec.md`
- Updated `tasks.md` with progress
- Proposed `spec.md` updates (for approval only—do not apply without approval)

## Workflow

### 1. Load context

- Read `spec.md` and `tasks.md`
- Confirm scope and change folder
- Identify current progress (checked tasks)

### 2. Execute tasks in order

For each unchecked task:

1. Understand the task and affected files
2. Implement the change
3. Validate (build/run/tests or targeted checks as appropriate)
4. Mark the task complete in `tasks.md`

Proceed sequentially unless reordering is clearly required for correctness.

### 3. Validation

- Prefer targeted checks when a full build is unnecessary
- Ensure changes align with **Success Criteria** in `spec.md`
- Ask the user to test or validate only if the agent cannot run the needed checks

### 4. Failure handling

If a task fails:

1. Fix obvious issues and **retry once**
2. If still failing: **stop**, explain the blocker, propose next steps, ask how to proceed

Do not introduce workarounds that change intent or degrade quality without approval.

### 5. Task evolution (allowed)

- Refine wording for clarity
- Split tasks into smaller steps
- Reorder tasks if needed for correctness

Do not alter task intent in a way that would change the spec.

### 6. Spec change handling

If implementation reveals incorrect assumptions, missing constraints, or a better approach that **changes intent**:

1. Propose the spec update clearly
2. **Do not** implement that divergent path yet
3. Wait for user approval
4. Update `spec.md` only after approval

### 7. Keep context accurate

- Keep `tasks.md` in sync with progress
- Add brief notes for edge cases, follow-ups, or partial work

## Stop conditions

Stop and ask if:

- A task cannot be completed after one retry
- A required spec change is identified
- The task list is insufficient or conflicts with the spec

## Completion

Implementation is complete when:

- All tasks are completed or explicitly resolved
- Code satisfies **Success Criteria** in `spec.md`
- No unresolved blockers remain

Then:

1. Summarize: tasks completed, deviations or notes, validation results. Be concise.
2. Ask: **Should I clean up and proceed with documentation?**
3. If yes: begin the **`document-change`** skill if available; otherwise document per repo conventions
